VM(Virtual Machine):
	A Virtual Machine is a software application that simulates 
	a computer but hides the underlying Operating system and 
	Hardware from the programs that interact with it. If the same 
	Virtual machine is implemented on many computer platforms,
	applications written for that type of VM can be used on all 
	those platforms.

JVM(Java Virtual Machine):
	a part of JDK and the foundation of java platform executes 
	Bytecode. It is one of the most widely used virtual machines.

In early java versions JVM was simply a Java Bytecode interpreter.Most programs would execute slowly 
because JVM would interpret and execute one bytecode at a time.
But today's JVM typically execute bytecodes using a combination of interpretation and just in time compilation.
In this process JVM analyzes the bytecode as they are interpreted, searching for Hotspots(bytecodes that execute
frequently).For these parts JIT compiler translates the bytecode into computer's Machine Language.When JVM 
encounters these compiled parts again, the faster machine language code executes.
