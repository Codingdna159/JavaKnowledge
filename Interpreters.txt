Compiling a High level language program directly into Machine language can take a
considerable amount of time.Interpreter programs were developed to execute high 
level programs directly avoiding the delay of compilation although they run 
slower than compiled programs.Java uses a clever performance-tuned mixture of 
compilation and interpretation to run programs.
