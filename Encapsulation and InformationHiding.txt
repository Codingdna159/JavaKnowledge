Classes encapsulate such that encase their attributes and methods.
A class's attributes and methods are intimately related.

Objects may communicate with one another but they are not allowed to 
see how other objects are implemented.Implementation details can 
be hidden within the objects themselves.This Information Hiding is 
crucial for hood software engineering.
