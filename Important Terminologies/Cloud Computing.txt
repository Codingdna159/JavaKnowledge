Saas and Paas are examples of cloud computing.You can use software and data stored in cloud 
via internet rather than storing it locally onto your desktop. This allows you to increase or
decrease computing resources to meet your needs at any given time which is more cost effective 
than purchasing hardware to provide enough storage and processing power to meet occasional 
peak demands. Cloud Computing also saves money by shifting to the service provider the burden 
of managing these apps (install,upgrade,security,backup,disaster recovery).
