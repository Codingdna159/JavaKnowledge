Software has generally been viewed as a product, most software still is offered this way. If one want to
run an application, he can buy software package from software vendor often a CD,DVD or a web download.
Then install it on to the computer and run as needed. As new versions appear he need to upgrade software 
at considerable cost in time and money. This process can become cumbersome.

With Software as a Servive(SaaS) the software runs on servers elsewhere on the internet. When the server is 
updated, all clients worldwide see the new capabilities.No local installation is needed. You access the 
service through a browser and browsers are quite portable . So you can run the same applications on a wide 
variety of computers from anywhere in the world.
