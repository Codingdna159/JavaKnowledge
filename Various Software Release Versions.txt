Alpha:
	Alpha Software is the earliest release of a software product that's still under active development.
Alpha versions are often buggy, incomplete, and unstable and are released to a relatively small number of 
developers for testing new features, getting early feedback etc. Alpha software is also called early access 
software.

Beta:
	Beta versions are released to a larger number of developers later in the development process after 
most major bugs have been fixed and new features are nearly complete.Beta software is more stable but still
subject to change.

Release Candidates:
	Release Candidates are generally feature complete, bug free and ready for use by the community which 
provides a diverse testing environment. The software is used on different systems with varying constraints and 
a variety of purposes.

Final Release:
	Any bugs that appear in the Release candidate are corrected and eventually the final product is released 
to the general public. Software companies often distribute incremental updates over the internet.

Continuous beta:
	Software that is developed using this approach usually does not have version numbers. It's hosted in the 
cloud and is constantly evolving so that users always have the latest version.
