Normally there are 5 phases

Edit -> Compile -> Load -> Verify -> Execute

Phase 1: Creating a program
	This phase consist of writing the java code using a editor program
	and saving it onto the hard disk with .java extension.

Phase 2: Compiling java program to Bytecode
	In this phase a .class file is created which consists of Bytecode
	which is platform independent. For compiling the command to be used 
	is (javac filename.java).

Now use command (java filename)

Phase 3: Loading a program into Memory
	In this phase JVM's class loader takes the.class file containing the 
	program's Bytecode and transfers them to primary memory. It also loads
	any of the .class files provided by java that your program uses.

Phase 4: Bytecode Verification
	In this phase Bytecode Verifier examines their bytecodes to ensure that
	they are valid and do not voilte java's security restrictions

Phase 5: Execution
	In this phase JVM executes the bytecodes to perform the program's 
	specified actions.
