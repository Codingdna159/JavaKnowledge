Programmers write instructions in various Programming languages some are
directly understand by computers and some require intermediate translation
steps. Hundreds of such languages are in use today. These are divided into 
3 general categories:

1. Machine languages:
	Any computer can directly understand only its own machine language,
	defined by it's hardware design. Machine languages generally consist 
	of strings of numbers(0s and 1's)that instruct computers to perform 
	their most elementary operation one at a time.Machine languages are 
	machine dependent.

2. Assembly Language:
	Programming in Machine Language was too slow and tedious for most 
	programmers So instead they start using English like abbreviations
	to represent elementary operations. These abbreviations are formed 
	on the basis of assembly language. Translator programs assemblers 
	are developed to convert early assembly language programs to 
	machine language at computer speeds.

3. High-Level Languages:
	With the advent of assembly language computer usage increased rapidly
	but still in order to perform simple tasks programmers had to write a
	lot of instructions. To speed up the programming process high level 
	languages were developed which can accompalish substantial tasks in
	single statement. Translator programs called Compilers convert high 
	level programs into machine language.
